Hi there. I (Yifei Lu) am currently a second-year master’s student at Beijing Normal University. My research interests include interactive technologies, human-computer interaction, and computer-mediated communication. More specifically, I am interested in exploring the direct psychophysiological responses to interactive technologies during entertainment and their role as a context for technology-mediated social connectedness that implicates social support. Meanwhile, I tend to relate those two research directions with digital well-being.
